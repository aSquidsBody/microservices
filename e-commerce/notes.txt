Start setup for the auth directory & app. Setup docker image and kubernetes deployment.

Create the skaffold.yaml file.

setup ingress-nginx for load balancer and load balancer service and ingeress service (ingress-srv.yaml).
  Test api/users/currentuser (return 'hi there'), but chrome doesn't allow it: type 'thisisunsafe' in tab to make it through


REQUEST BODY VALIDATION
  Validate that the contents of a request are present:
  'npm install express-validator'


HANDLING ASYNC CODE IN ERRORS:
  
  We want:
    app.all("*", async (req, res) => {
      throw new NotFoundError();
    });

  not:
    app.all("*", async (req, res, next) => {
      next(new NotFoundError());
    });

  In order to handle errors this way, we need 'express-async-errors';
  Add to index.ts 
    import "express-async-errors"

DATABASE
  Use MongoDB
    'npm install mongoose'
    
    Needs a yaml file for it as a deployment: '<service>-mongo-depl.yaml'

    Mongoose model definition has issues with Typescript:
      Solution: see 'auth/srv/models/user.ts'

AUTHENTICATION:
  Cookies will not be encrypted (Json Web Tokens are tamper proof automatically and we are not sending
    secure data over a cookie).
  Use node package jsonwebtoken to create the web tokens (also @types/jsonwebtoken).

  Decode session cookie using Base64 Decoder. Then use the jwt.io tool to validate the json web token

SECRETS:
  Create a secret using kubernetes:

    'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>'
  
    * Generic secret: this is for all-purpose secrets
    * secret-name: the name of the secret (we used jwt-secret)

    (Look in secret location for my secret)

    View secrets with:
      'kubectl get secrets'

    Put secret in the pods as environment variable:
      See 'infra/k8s/auth-depl.yaml'.
      Search for 'JWT_KEY'

TESTING:
  Use library 'Jest'
  'ts-jest' is what allows for typescript work. If a test fails, then I fix it, but it still fails, just restart jest.

  Add script:
    * "test": "jest --watchAll --no-cache"
      * --watchAll (run all tests in the project when files change)
      * --no-cache (jest doesn't work with ts, this no-cache flag will help deal with changes that jest doesnt see)

  Add to package.json:
    * "jest": {
        "preset": "ts-jest",
        "testEnvironment": "node",
        "setupFilesAfterEnv": [
          "./src/test/setup.ts"
        ]
      },

  Will:
    Start an in-memory copy of MongoDB
    start up our express app
    use 'supertest' library to make fake requests to our express app

  Run 'npm install --save-dev @types/jest @types/supertest jest ts-jest supertest mongodb-memory-server'

    --save-dev: we don't want the test stuff in the docker image (since mongodb-memory-server is large), so 
                the Dockerfile will be marked to ignore these dev packages

    jest: javascript TESTING

    supertest: HTTP assertions made easy via superagent.

    mongodb-memory-server: runs a copy of mongo in memory. Easily test multiple databases at the same time
                           Allows us to test multiple services with their own databases at the same time.

NAMESPACES:
  'kubectl get namespaces'
  'kubectl get services -n <namespace>'

  In my case, there is a LoadBalancer called ingress-nginx-controller in ingress-nginx.
  So to reach out to this service in a container in the cluster
    use: 'http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local'
    with header: 'Host: <hostname_from_ingress-srv.yaml>'

REUSED CODE:
  We will have a common library that we will publish to npm registry

  Security:
    If there is sensitive information in our common library, we don't have to publish to the public registry 
      Can publish to public/private Organization registry, or a private registry (invite only).
    
    We will use a public organization registry.

  Name format:
    '@<organization>/<package_name>'

  Publish:
    1. Create a git repo inside the package (package.json level)
      'git init'
      'git add .'
      'git commit -m "first commit"'
    2. Publish using the npm publish command
      'npm publish --access public' // note it defaults to private registry, hence the public option
    3. (FIRST TIME) Setup typescript configurations
      'tsc --init' to create a tsconfig.json file
      'npm install typescript del-cli --save-dev' (note the --save-dev, these are not to be published)
    4. (FIRST TIME) Configure the tsconfig
      a. Add "build": "npm run clean && tsc" in the package.json
      b. Uncomment the following lines from tsconfig.json
        i. "declaration": true, 
        ii. "outDir": "./",  (CHANGE THE VALUE TO "./build")
    5. (FIRST TIME) Setup delete script
      Add "clean": "del ./build/*" to package.json (why we needed del-cli)
    6. (FIRST TIME) Indicate the files to be published
      a. Change"main": "./build/index.js", in package.json (since the index.js has been moved)
      b. Add "types": "./build/index.d.ts", in package.json
      c. Add "files": [
                    "build/**/*"
                  ], 
        (indicates which files are 100% to be included in the published package)
    7. (FIRST TIME) Configure .gitignore to ignore the build/ and node_modules/ directories
    8. Publish
      a. Add and commit to git the changes you want.
      b. When ready to publish, update the version number in package.json
      c. Run 'npm publish'
  
  Typescript:
    Our common library will be written in Typescript but published in Javascript

  INSTALL:
    'npm install <package_name>' (including organization)

  UPDATE:
    'npm update <package_name>' (including organization)
