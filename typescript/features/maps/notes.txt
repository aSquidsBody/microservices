Using parcel bundler

'npm install -g parcel-bundler'

Don't need to create a package.json, 'parcel index.html will automatically set everything up'

Randomly generate data
  npmjs.com => search for 'faker'.
  faker package has module address to randomly generate position data.
  'npm install faker'

  Since we are using a javascript module in a Typescript project
    Need a typed naming scheme for the faker library. So we need to get it from Definitely Typed, 
    probs called @types/faker
    'npm install @types/faker'
